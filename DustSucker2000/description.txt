DustSucker2000 Simulator by Ramin Assadi

This Software creates a toy inside a room with a couple of different commands
to controll the toy with. The user gets three options. The first one is to
choose the dimensions of the room(x y). The second one is to choose the
direction and position of the toy(direction x y). The last option is the
series of commands for the toy to execute(RLARLARL). The program will then
calculate the position of the toy after the commands.

Directions: N = North, E = East, W = West, S = South
Commands: R = Right turn, L = Left turn, A = Move forward
